	•	Smoothed out experience
	•	
	•	Stages are 
	•	1 Discovery and research 
	•	2 Synthesizing research and design strategy

Iterative process, cycles through to refine product with each revolution. 

“UX is the design of anything, independent of medium or across media, with human experience as an explicit outcome and human engagement as an explicit goal.”

Agile design process
Small cross functional teams

One process is complete, the process begins again and repeats continuously to create new, better versions  

. Start with user research 
. Build something based off of that research 
. Test what you’ve built
. Repeat

UX design approach with five phases:
	•	Discovery and research
	•	Synthesizing research and design strategy
	•	Placement and layout design
	•	Execution
	•	Usability testing
